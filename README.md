Upload a verizon bill in PDF format, and the program returns the total amount due by each member of the family plan.

I took each person's Monthly Access Charges and took only the individual's services(txt/data/etc), and added the rest(voice plan + extra line fees) to a shared charges pool. Then I figured out what percentage of the user's surcharges and taxes they should pay based on their specific access charges, the rest of the taxes and surcharges ( those that apply to shared services) are added to the shared pool along with the shared service charges(voice plan + extra lines). Finally the pool is divided equally between everyone, so everyone pays their own actual portion of the bill. Sometimes there can be rounding errors that would cause the total to come up a penny or two short, so when that happens I add or remove a penny from someones total at random to make the total paid amount match the total due amount.
